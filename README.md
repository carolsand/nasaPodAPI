# nasaPodAPI

Here's the project you'll need to complete this week. It's designed to help you get active interacting with external APIs and building your own.

Please note: you do not need to build a front-end for this. You can use CURL via the command line or another REST API testing tool to interact with your API app. If you feel you have the time to create a front-end (especially if you're using an app framework), go for it!

Guidelines

Use NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API at https://api.nasa.gov/index.html
All input and output data must be in JSON format
Build your app in Express.js (this is important for Labelbox)
Functionality

Fetch and save a NASA picture to the database
Create and delete users (only an email field is needed)
Save a 1-5 star rating of a picture for a user
Update a picture rating for a user
Delete a user rating
Get all of a user's ratings
Steps

Choose a database (must be installed locally so it's easily reproducible)
Create GitHub repository with a README
Make your repository public and email the link to learn@speak.careers
Whiteboard a RESTful architecture (export a JPG of this to include on your README page)
Code your endpoints
Have your pair partner test your API locally on their computer
If time allows, build unit tests for your code
Check in your code on Github as you build to share your progress.

If you have any questions, please ask in Discord at the beginning of the week. Have fun and happy coding!
